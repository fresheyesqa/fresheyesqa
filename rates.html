                      <h3>QA Projects</h3>
                      <p>Projects start at $500 per app or website. Cost is affected by a number of factors, including the number of pages or views that need to be tested, the complexity of flows or number of user types, access to a local copy of the code and turnaround time needed. Rush options are available, and the cost will depend on the schedule of currently-booked clients.</li>

                      <h3>Individual Training</h3>
                      <p>One person taking a course will pay $250 per course. That training will include 3-5 hours of training content over video, as well as relevant paperwork or workersheets, and a list of resources for how to take the next steps. </p>

                    <div class="box post">
                      <h3>Team Training</h3>
                      <p>Team Trainings start at $1500 for three people, and go up $400 per person after that, for a maximum of 6 people. Team trainings are more customizable, and include an initial call or email form requesting specific topics that you would like covered. Customizations will require research time, and this will be factored into scheduling the trainings.</p>

                      <p>Fresh Eyes QA is available on an hourly basis, and rates will depend on the scope and nature of work and other client obligations.</p>

                      <h3>Process</h3>
                      <p>Our first call will cover the scope of what you'd like tested, and you'll receive an estimate of the cost, a proposal of work, and payment schedule. 25% of payment is due upon signing, 25% more will be due at the midpoint check-in, and the final 50% will be due upon reciept of work.</p>
                      <p>If you'd prefer to work on an ongoing basis, we'll start with a small project, 5-20 hours, to make sure we're on the same page. After that, we'll discuss weekly availability, and invoices will be sent monthly.</p>
